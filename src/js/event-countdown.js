/** Counter implementation in vanilla JavaScript (ES6 - ECMAScript 6) **/

// Let's define our variables first:

// A global variable, for accesing the interval


// The two HTML DOM nodes for the countdown text and the countdown time



// Let's start building our functions:

/**
 * Initialize the countdown, which should be updated in a one second interval
 */




/**
 * Get the date for the upcoming event and the current date,
 * calculate the date difference and pass this difference
 * for creating the text strings for the HTML.
 */








/**
 * Get the text strings for the countdown text and time.
 * @param {Date} date
 *    The date difference between the current date
 *    and the date of the upcoming event
 */
























  // Finally write the respective text strings to the HTML




// As soon as the scripts is fully loaded by the browser,
// this function should be immediately called for starting the countdown
